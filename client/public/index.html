      content="A bunch of guys (Jonny, Joey and Gaby) who have a passion for bringing life back to all vintage collectibles. We started out of a garage and now we have a small store on 255 Herbert Ave. Closter, NJ. We specialize in Vinyl Records, Video games, and Art. We connect with our community to revive vintage items we find. JJ’s Shop officially established January 2021 is a local Vinyl Record/Collectible store with the main focus of connecting with our community. Our goal is to open a local café with Vinyl, Video games, and Art so that we give back to the community that supported us!"
