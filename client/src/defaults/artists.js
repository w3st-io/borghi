		description: `
			Nicholas received his Bachelors from Pratt Institute, graduating cum laude, and his MFA from Lehman College. Throughout his art career he had several studios and many solo and group exhibitions. His work is in many private collections and in The Hudson River Museum. Nicholas' exploration of the visual relationships and effects of light on form, structure, and space have remained and evolved over four decades of his work.
			<br><br>
			Nicholas taught art in middle school, high school and college, always as a conduit for his own work. In his later years he campaigned for an art gallery for his middle school students. It was the only one we are aware of in the state, and a smashing success. Nicholas ignited passion for the arts in countless numbers of young people. Students with and without natural art skill excelled under his enthusiastic tutelage. The work he was able to encourage out of them was incredible, and often award-winning. He was adored by his students and colleagues; a true one-of-a-kind generous spirit”. 
			<br><br>
			The following 10 works by Nicholas Barbieri were inspired by one of our famous American Abstract Expressionist painter Joan Mitchell (American 1925 - 1992).

		description: `
			Clintel Steed, an American artist living and exhibiting in New York City, holds a BFA in Painting from the Art Institute of Chicago, an MFA from Indiana University and completed Advanced Studies at the New York Studio School of Drawing, Painting and Sculpture. 
			<br><br>
			Born in 1977 and raised in a devoutly Pentecostal Christian household in Utah, Clintel's childhood centered around the church. This devotion prominently figures in his work to this day as an exploration of moments, feelings, situations and experiences through art. 
			<br><br>
			In 2001, Clintel drove to New York City with his easel tied to the top of his car and settled in Harlem. Finding representation with Borghi Fine Art Gallery, exhibitions throughout New York City, the Hamptons, Philadelphia and winning the John Koch award from the Academy of Arts and Letters in 2015, Clintel is an artist who represents the urgency and grit that was synonymous with New York City in the 1970's and 1980's. 
			<br><br>
			“The battle between good and evil, heaven and hell was preached all the time. This struggle is still within me, the lust for money and the battle for power.” Clintel's studio is in the Sunset Park area of Brooklyn, one of the last vestiges of unadulterated New York art studio space.

		name: 'Alexander Calder',

		description: `
			Alexander Calder is best known for creating mobiles—sculptures composed of abstract shapes moving through space. Born in 1898, in the Philadelphia area, Calder came from a family of artists. Both his father and his grandfather were sculptors. After graduating from the Stevens Institute of Technology in 1919 with a degree in mechanical engineering, “Sandy” (as he was known by his friends) held various jobs before entering the Art Students League of New York in 1923. In the early 1920s he worked as an illustrator, covering such events as the circus. His sketches of circus acts rekindled his childhood fascination with animals, a subject that became central to his art. In 1926 he went to Paris for the first time and stayed there until the fall of 1927. An active participant in the avant-garde milieu of Paris between the two World Wars, Calder had a wide circle of friends and colleagues in the arts. He met many of them through performances of his entourage of small sculptures, Circus, in the late twenties and through his membership from 1931 in the Abstraction-Création group, a loose alliance of artists promoting diverse multi-national trends in abstract art.
			<br><br>
			It was at this time that he began making small moveable animal figures in wood and in wire, using the wire as if he were drawing in space. By 1928, Calder was exhibiting his wire sculptures both in the United States and in France, where he resided periodically throughout his life. Calder created his first abstract wire sculptures in the spring of 1931, and that year Galerie Percier in Paris held an exhibition of these works, which Arp called “stabiles.” By 1932, Calder was composing his forms with the intention of making them move through space. First he experimented with motorized sculptures. But soon, by precisely adjusting the weight and balance of each shape, he created works that floated through space, propelled only by air currents. Known as mobiles, the term was coined by Calder 's fellow artist, Marcel Duchamp.
			<br><br>
			Dividing his time between homes in Roxbury, Connecticut, and Saché, France, Calder produced a large body of works in a wide variety of mediums. His work was exhibited in several large retrospectives at the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum, New York (1964), the Musée National d 'Art Moderne, Paris (1965), the Museum of Contemporary Art, Chicago (1974), and the Whitney Museum of American Art, New York (1976). In November 1976, soon after the opening of this last retrospective, which he personally installed, Calder died in New York.

			Virginia Baker was born in Texas in 1933. She began to fulfill a lifetime dream of studying art in 1993 when she entered the prestigious Glassell School of Art whom is also affiliated with the Museum of Fine Arts in Houston. She developed a love for watercolors, embracing her emotions and movements to create an abstract image of her inner spirit. 
			<br><br>
			<i>"I am an abstract artist that expresses emotion, movement and action. I am led by watercolor magic as the paint and water begin to mix and flow across the paper. I paint - -mostly- -”Wet into Wet”. My work has been described as vibrant, uplifting and joyful. That is my goal each time I approach the paper. The medieval symbol that follows my signature on every painting represents 'Mind, Body, Soul'"</i>
			<br><br>
			-Virginia Baker
			<br><br>
			Virginia has had group and solo exhibitions from 2011 - 2015. Her awards include Juried International WAS exhibition, Show of Champions, Watercolor Society and Houston Civic Art League and Watercolor Division. Her watercolors can be found in private collections and permanent collections such as Northwestern Insurance, and Texas AMM University.

		name: 'Justin Fontaine Maury',
		image: 'https://images2.imgbox.com/04/1b/3gfK3vx8_o.jpg',
		description: `
			Justin is an American artist born in 1988, who studied photography and design. Born in Englewood New Jersey. Maury creates artworks that combine skills from his studies in both of these areas, along with the use of found objects, paint, and resin to create a final product that has a great amount of texture and depth. Coming from a background of design, Maury's works have a transparent structure that can be traced back to his time working as a designer for a branding company in New York City. He uses digital methods to enlarge photographs inspired by vintage adult film posters and classified ads overlooked by pop culture due to their taboo nature. He later paints over portions of photographs to create painted backgrounds for the figures. Justin then sands the layers of paint to give the work a texture which is exaggerated by a thick layer of resin. The resin coating is both a structural and aesthetic choice on the part of the artist as it binds the layers of paint together on the wooden surface rendering the painting much more stable and increasing the transparency of the artistic method.
			<br><br>		
			The work of Justin Maury is undoubtedly connected to the phenomena of language and image occurrence in 	popular culture. The words that take over many of Maury's works - which sometimes contain the title of the piece - always seem to be critically linked to image at hand. Maury plays with conceptions of language and image by having the figure obstruct the full comprehension of and vice versa. The viewers' constant battle to define the figure from the word becomes a futile attempt with some of Maury's new works, raising interesting questions about the nature of American popular ad culture and the inherent human desire to link image and language. Another recurring painterly element of the artist's works is the outlining of the human form with paint. This seems to be a theme in figural works without words, an aesthetic leitmotif which works to remove the adopted commercial image from the environment of advertisement to place it back into the aesthetic realm, The outline redefines the image it surrounds, creating an aesthetic form that negates legibility as a commercial product and is left only to be observed as painting, figure, color and form.

		description: `
			Marcos Grigorian (Armenian: Մարկոս Գրիգորեան; Persian: مارکو گريگوريان‎‎; December 5, 1925 - August 27, 2007) was a notable Iranian-Armenian artist and a pioneer of Iranian modern art.
			<br><br>
			Grigorian was born in Kropotkin, Russia, to an Armenian family from Kars who had fled that city to escape massacres when it was captured by Turkey in 1920. In 1930 the family moved from Kropotkin to Iran, living first in Tabriz, and then in Tehran. After finishing pre-university education in Iran, in 1950 he studied at the Accademia di Belle Arti in Rome. Graduating from there in 1954, he returned to Iran, opened the Galerie Esthétique, an important commercial gallery in Tehran. In 1958, under the auspices of the Ministry of Culture, he organized the first Tehran Biennial. Grigorian was also an influential teacher at the Fine Arts Academy, where he disseminated his enthusiasm for local popular culture, including coffee-house paintings, a type of folk art named after the locations in which they were often displayed.
			<br><br>
			In 1975 Grigorian helped organize the group of free painters and sculptors in Tehran and was one of its founder members. Artists Gholamhossein Nami, Massoud Arabshahi, Morteza Momayez, Mir Abdolrez Daryabeigi, and Faramarz Pilaram were amongst the other members of the group. As a modernist pop artist Marcos Grigorian turned to ordinary objects and popular ethnic forms and approaches. He used ethnic food such as "Nan Sangak" and "Abghousht" to evoke authenticity in his work. Grigorian was a trend setter in experimenting with Earth Art, in Iran.
			<br><br>
			Grigorian left Iran in 1977 at the age of 52. He lived for a short time in the United States before moving to Yerevan, Armenia, then still a republic of the Soviet Union. In 1989, he traveled to Russia at the invitation of the Union of Russian Artists, visiting Moscow and Leningrad.
			<br><br>
			He exhibited his clay and straw works in Yerevan in 1991. He later donated 5,000 of his artworks to the government of Armenia. In 1993 he founded the "Museum of the Middle East" in Yerevan: 2,600 exhibits are on display, with most of them coming from his own collection.
			<br><br>
			Some of his works are now on display at the Museum of Modern Art in New York City, the Tehran Museum of Contemporary Art, the Museum of Contemporary Art in Kerman, and the National Gallery of Armenia.
			<br><br>
			On 4 August 2007 Grigorian was assaulted and beaten about the head by two masked robbers who had broken into his Yerevan home. It was speculated that the robbers believed, erroneously, that there was a large sum of money in the house, proceeds from the sale of Grigorian's summer residence in Garni. After an anonymous phone call to police, Grigorian was discovered injured and taken to hospital.
			<br><br>
			<br><br>
			He died of a suspected heart attack on 27 August 2007, a day after leaving the hospital.
